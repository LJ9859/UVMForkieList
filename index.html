  <h1>These are forkies and annoying people that are present on UserVM.</h1>
  <h2>Forkies:</h2>
  <p>Emmanuel Flores/Vista/Ubuntu - Restarts for no reason, and does Monoxide abuse on VMs</p>
  <p>sprunki - Constantly tries to upgrade/downgrade to Windows 8.1, dont know why</p>
  <p></p>
  <h2>Complainers (people who aren't forkies but wont stfu)</h2>
  <p>Windows 11 - Won't shut up about a city bus theme I put on XP, technically is a forkie for supporting other people installing monoxide, also gets extremely fucking mad if you say "city bus go beep beep :-)"</p>
  <p>Charmander - Won't be quiet about me complaining about forkies ruining the OS, which is a valid complaint, also links to very outdated screenshots of me complaining, and is digging up info on me for no reason</p>
  <p>guest30208 - Is a literal fucking copy machine, won't shut up and just repeats what you say like a parrot with brain disease</p>
  <h2>Stay away from the above people on UserVM and CollabVM. -LJ9859</h2>
